## Missing Data Simulation

A common problem in data analysis is missing data.  The missigness mechanisms describe the nature of how the data is missing: missing at random (MAR), missing completely at random (MCAR), or missing not at random (MNAR).  

In this simulation, I explore different missing data techniques including listwise deletion, mean imputation, regression imputation, multiple imputation, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (EM), for each of the missigness mechnanisms.
